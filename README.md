# Code Review Guidelines
The purpose of this guide is to define standards for all code reviews done by contributors and builders in the UTU Protocol ecosystem and also ensure that code written by Andela fellows are contributors and team members is top notch and excellent. These guidelines are to be applied for checkpoint assessments as well as regular day to day code reviews performed in your role as a contributing Engineer or team member.

As an sofware engineer, code review is one of the most important aspects of what you do and doing it right is instrumental to grooming the right type of engineers and writing effective code in general.
